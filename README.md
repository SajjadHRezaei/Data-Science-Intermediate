**The structure of folders**

This repository has been created by Champions team in which all members are studying data science in Comemit academy.
There are 7 files in this repository which all have been written in python language. The first file which is exercise01,
is a project in which two wine quality datasets have been visualized by Dash framework. The second file (exercise02) is 
a project in which the aim of the project is transfering Pandas dataframe to SQL database and  also converting the SQL
queryâ€™s result into a Pandas dataframe. Exercise03 is a project in order to visualisation and clustering of Handwritten
digits dataset. In the fourth project (exercise04) an artificial dataset has been created and then it has been clustered
by different clustering methods such as K-Means and Agglomerative clustering.In the next project (exercise05), with a dataset
consisting of Volkswagen used cars information, some regression methods have been tested and evaluated to predict the closest 
price based on features provided in the dataset. The sixth project (exercise06) is about a dataset named Heart Disease
datastet which is a popular classification datasets. The goal of project is to predict the target, does a subject suffers from
heart disease or not. And the final project (exercise07) is a classification exercise on Handwritten digits and white wine 
quality datasets.
